								<h1>Mo</h1>
								<p>Hi, I'm Yucong Mo. Feel free to call me Mo, because that's easier for everybody.<br>
									<br>
									I am a second-year masters student at Utah State University, advised by <a href="https://www.usu.edu/cs/people/CurtisDyreson/">Dr. Curtis Dyreson</a>. <br>
									I am passionate about software development and database management system.<br>
									<br>
									It's my pleasure to have you here! Click on the tabs below to learn more about me.<br>

								<h2 class="major">King of Bots</h2>
								<b>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> Java, Spring, MySQL, Vue, User Authentication</h4>
								</b>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/kob.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This is an online player versus player snake game.  
								</p>
								<p>
									Two players compete against each other in a game of snake on a randomly generated map with obstacles. 
									As the game progresses, the snakes grow one unit larger every 10 rounds. 
									However, if a snake collides with an obstacle or any part of its own body, it dies. After the game, the
									players get to see their ranking score.
								</p>
								
								<h2 class="major">My Own Text Editor</h2>
								<b>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> C, Terminal Level IO, File IO, System Programming, Algorithms design and implementation</h4>
								</b>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/molio.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This is a simple text editor that supports basic features like syntax highlighting and searching. It was
									inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/antirez/kilo">Kilo project</a>.

									I built it to have a better understanding of how general text editors work and to get familiar with C. I now
									use it on a daily basis for light text editing.
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">My Own Git</h2>
								<b>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> Python, Git internals</h4>
								</b>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/mogit.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									I implemented my own version of git to understand the internals of it. It employs SHA-1 encryption
									and provides efficient management of local repositories. Core functions of git like init, add, log, commit, branch, 
									etc. are implemented.

								</p>
								
								<h2 class="major">Automation Tool</h2>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/AECOM.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This project is done during my work at AECOM, Beijing. 
									It is a terminal application that can automatically rename all the unformatted construction files and upload them to 
									the internal database, saving lots of time for the engineers.

								<h2 class="major">Location Based Chat</h2>
								<b>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> Java, Spring, Postgres, WebSocket, Geolocation API</h4>
									
								</b>

								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/locChat.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This is a project I built with another 2 team members in a hackathon activity. This is an application that lets users chat
								with people that are in the same general location as they are. This would be useful for conferences, fairs, sporting events, and 
								any other kind of large social gathering.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a member of the team, I handled the implementation of the backend system using Java Spring framework and Postgres, 
									as well as designed the data models for the database pages.
									I also played a key role in integrating the front-end and API endpoint to ensure the smooth functioning of the project. 
									The project was previously deployed on Heroku, but Heroku is no longer offering free application hosting so we decided to take it down.
							
								<h2 class="major">Dewey Level Encoding Database</h2>
								<b>
						
									<h4>Keywords: <br>Research Project, Database Indexing, Java, Xmorph</h4>
								
								</b>

								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/dewey.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This is a research project that I am working on with <a href="https://www.usu.edu/cs/people/CurtisDyreson/">Dr. Curtis Dyreson</a> at USU.
									The main idea is to impose the dewel level encoding model on a existing relational model, and then to compare the performance difference between these
									two models on <a href="https://www.usu.edu/cs/people/CurtisDyreson/XMorph/">Xmorph</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									As part of an ongoing research project, I have designed and implemented an algorithm that efficiently transfers 
									relational data models into a prefixed, tree-like data model. 
									We are currently fine-tuning our data model to achieve better performance before publishing our results.

		
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Movie Communities Detection</h2>
								<p>
									In this project, we analyze movie networks using graph theory. 
									Each movie network is constructed by character nodes connected by edges that represent their interactions. 
									My primary responsibilities included building a pipeline for graph processing, parsing graph metadata, 
									applying graph algorithms to the networks, 
									and detecting character communities within them.
